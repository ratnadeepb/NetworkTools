Dear User,

This utility is completely written in Python with some help from Batch and Bash.
Ideally it can run on both Windows and Linux machines. For MAC users, this has unfortunately not
been tested but probably would work. If you test it please drop me a line.

So this utility basically asks for two IPs from you:
A starting IP
An ending IP

The utility will generate all the IPs in between automatically. However, that does not mean
that you should watch out for memory utilisation during scanning a large subnet. Whether you
scan a 100 IPs or 10,000,000 - the performance should be the same.

At the present time, scanning 10,000,000 IPs may take quite some time though and it is my
sincere belief that you mostly won't have requirements like that.

Finally, you can provide a custom path where to save the report. If not, the utility will do so on your
behalf.

########## Requirements: ##########
For *NIX users:
	It should run out of the box. Your system mostly has everything.
For Windows users:
	You need:
		1. Python 2.7
		2. The packages - os, sys, subprocess and re
		3. The nc.exe is provided with this package

########## What to Expect from Future Versions: ##########
1. Optimizations to speed up the utility.
2. A GUI based interface is planned.
3. A packaging for Windows so that all those painful installations are not required.

P.S. 1 has at least an order of magnitude more priority than 2. The priority for 3 unfortunately is
even lower. However, the code is open and please feel free to hack away.
